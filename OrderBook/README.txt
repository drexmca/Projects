This file takes in one day of trades of Google data, and constructs an orderbook.
It then plots and measures the average spread, based on whatever interval you want.
Then calculates the velocity of money, and the probability of 'Market Traders' or those who are slightly more informed than the random noise of the market. 
Most of all, it's just a cool order book program I built for a class.
